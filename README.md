# Cosa-Shell

This Cosa library supports command interpreter implementation. The
interpreter is table driven and handles the prompt, parsing and
execution of commands. Commands are defined by a table entry and a
function.


# Install

To use this library you must download and install the [Arduino IDE] (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (or
GCC AVR toolchain) and [Cosa] (https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa).

Download and unzip the Cosa-Shell library into your sketchbook
libraries directory. Rename from Cosa-Shell-master to Shell.

The Shell library and examples should be found in the Arduino IDE
File>Sketchbook menu. Open the CosaShell example sketch. Select
the Cosa core by selecting one of the Cosa boards in the Tools>Board
menu.
